# Highschool-Small-Projects

## Description

This repository contains some of the small projects I did in highschool. 
With my highschool, we did many small projects; this one was the one that really marked me.
I found this project interesting since this is my first time touching the front and back end of a website.
Even though it is basic, it was a great experience for me as my first time doing a full stack project.
